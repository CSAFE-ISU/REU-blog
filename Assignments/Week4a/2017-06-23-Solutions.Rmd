## Introduction

This report contains my data analysis of a scan of a bullet. This data is stored in the file [bullet.csv](./bullet.csv). The data I analyze is one crosscut of a 3D bullet scan at the micrometer level. The red dotted line in the image below shows an example of a bullet crosscut like the one I analyze. To better understand this data, I looked at a plot of it.

## Plot

This is my plot. On the *x*-axis, I put the "y" value in my data set. This "y" value is the horizontal position (on the red dotted line) in the image above. On the *y*-axis in my plot, I put the "resid" value in my data set. This "resid" value represents the depth of the striation marks in the bullet. Recall that these values are all measured in micrometers ($\mu$m).

<!-- In the brackets below, delete `eval = FALSE` before clicking `knit` -->
```{r myPlot}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
# first mistake: read.cvs instead of read.csv.
bullet <- read.csv("bullet.csv")
head(bullet)
```

**You should have noticed at this point that the values for `y` are NOT what the student says they are. So, you should have converted them to numeric values first.**

```{r Numbers}
bullet$y <- parse_number(bullet$y)
```

### Now, the correct plot 

```{r myPlotCorrect}
ggplot(data = bullet) + 
  geom_line(aes(x= y, y = resid))
```

## Summarizing my data

That was a very pretty plot! Let's look at a summary of the data:

```{r mySummary}
summary(bullet)
```

## One more plot

Finally, I look for outliers in the data. Outliers are typically defined as values greater than two standard deviations above the mean, and as values less than two standard deviations below the mean.

<!-- In the brackets below, delete `eval = FALSE` before clicking `knit` -->
```{r myPlot2}
library(tidyr)
myLines <- data.frame(meanValue = mean(bullet$resid), 
           OutliersAtLeft = mean(bullet$resid) - 2*sd(bullet$resid),
           OutliersAtRight = mean(bullet$resid) + 2*sd(bullet$resid))
myLines <- myLines %>% gather(id, value)
# mistake: the %>% in the next line should be a + 
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = bullet, aes(x = resid), binwidth = .25) + 
  geom_vline(data = myLines, aes(xintercept = value), color = 'red') +
  # mistake: the plot title isn't added because
  # the student forgot to put a + at the end of the next line
  geom_label(data = myLines, aes(x = value, y = 100, label = id)) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of the height of the striation marks", 
          subtitle = "Outliers lie outside of the redlines")
```

This was a great learning experience about bullets (and RMarkdown)!
